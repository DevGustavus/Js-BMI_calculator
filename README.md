## ðŸ“– About the project
In this project, I created a web-based BMI calculator. I implemented a straightforward form with a focus on UI/UX, responsiveness, and various validations. Additionally, I incorporated numerous conditional statements using if and else to analyze the user's input information for BMI. Depending on the input, distinct pop-ups are displayed, providing a tailored user experience.
